# Frontend Mentor - Conference ticket generator solution

This is my solution to the [Conference ticket generator challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/conference-ticket-generator-oq5gFIU12w). This project provided a great opportunity to practice form validation, accessibility, responsive design, and dynamic DOM manipulation.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form with their details
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - Any field is missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - The avatar upload is too big or the wrong image format
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, form field hints, and error messages announced on their screen reader
- See the generated conference ticket when they successfully submit the form
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Mobile-first design
- Vanilla JavaScript (DOM manipulation, validation)
- Accessibility best practices
- Frontend Mentor Starter Files

### What I learned

This project helped me solidify several key frontend concepts:
- Handling custom avatar uploads and displaying previews
- Managing responsive layouts with media queries
- Validating form inputs with JavaScript
- Using object-fit: cover to crop images neatly within fixed-size containers
- Making forms accessible to screen readers using aria attributes and proper markup

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to:
- Integrate drag-and-drop image upload functionality
- Enhance ticket styling with custom SVG elements
- Add backend support for saving submitted tickets
- Improve accessibility using more thorough ARIA practices

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://www.example.com) - For understanding HTML, CSS, and JS best practices
- [A11y Project](https://www.a11yproject.com/) - For accessibility enhancements
